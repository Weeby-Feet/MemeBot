# MemeBot

A bot for generating memes in your discord server. 

The bot uses the Imgflip API to both get the templates and place the text on top of them. 

To get a random template, simply type "meme" in the text channel.
To add text to a template, type "gen-MEME_ID-TEXT1-TEXT2..."

MEME_ID is the unique identifier that is sent along with the template.
TEXT1 is the text that will appear in the first text box.
TEXT 2 is the text that will appear in the second text box and so on. 

The number of avilable text boxes for a given template is also given along with the blank template. Entering more text than the template allows will simply result in the bot printing the text that will fit and dropping the rest.
